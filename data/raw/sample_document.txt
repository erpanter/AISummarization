In a historic event on March 15, 2025, leaders from the United Nations gathered in Geneva, Switzerland, 
to discuss the global response to climate change. Among the attendees were Ant√≥nio Guterres, the Secretary-General 
of the United Nations, and Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission. The summit aimed to 
strengthen commitments made under the Paris Agreement and address urgent issues such as rising sea levels, 
deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, and the rapid melting of polar ice caps.

During the conference, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced a $500 million funding package to assist 
developing nations in transitioning to renewable energy sources. This funding is expected to benefit countries in 
Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America, where infrastructure development remains a challenge.

Later in the day, a panel discussion led by Dr. Jane Goodall focused on the role of biodiversity in maintaining 
ecological balance. Dr. Goodall emphasized the importance of protecting endangered species, including orangutans 
in Borneo and tigers in India, as part of a broader environmental conservation strategy.

The summit concluded with the signing of the Geneva Climate Accord, a non-binding but symbolically important 
agreement that encourages countries to submit more ambitious climate action plans before the next global 
summit in New York City, scheduled for September 2026.
